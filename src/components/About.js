          I'm fluent in English, enjoy practicing contact sports and playing basketball, as well as
          strategy video games. I'm passionate about personal development and a
          dedicated reader. I love traveling and attend tech conferences and
          hackathons. Iâ€™m enthusiastic about contributing to open-source and
          creating projects from scratch with like-minded people.
