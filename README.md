## 🤖 AI Integration

This portfolio features a built-in conversational assistant powered by large language models (LLMs), showcasing real backend logic and prompt engineering.

- **FastAPI Backend** – Handles user questions and communicates with the language model via a structured API endpoint (`/ask`), including validation, error handling, and request optimization.

- **OpenRouter API** – Connects to models like GPT-3.5, Mistral 7B, and Claude, with easy switching for different providers depending on use case.

- **Custom Prompting Logic** – Dynamically constructs prompts to give the AI relevant context about my experience, projects, and skills, ensuring accurate and helpful answers.

- **Frontend Integration** – Responses are streamed back and rendered in a clean React-based UI, with support for loading states and message history.

This integration demonstrates not just AI usage, but also practical API handling, prompt design, and UI-to-backend communication — essential skills for real-world AI-powered applications.
